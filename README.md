# xr-scene-generator

Access a demo of the application [here](https://matteol-w.github.io/xr-scene-generator/).

This project is a 3D scene generator built with **React-Three-Fiber**. It allows users to create and manipulate 3D scenes with various objects and lighting options. The application supports multiple languages, including English, Japanese and French. But above all, AR and VR immersions are accessible with a single click.

## Features

- Add and manipulate 3D objects in the scene.
- Intuitive controls for object manipulation, inspired by Blender.
- Adjust properties such as position, rotation, scale, material color...
- Immerse within VR and AR in a single click.
- In the XR environment, 3D objects can exhibit various behaviors such as floating, interacting with the controller, or being governed by physics.
- Control lighting with options for ambient light, directional light, point light, and spotlight.
- Modify the skybox with basic and user presets.
- Easily add new 3D objects or skybox presets.
- Automatically save the scene in the browser's local storage.
- Load external GLB objects (which won't be automatically saved).
